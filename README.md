# About Pet Contest

Our objectives for this project was to create an app that allows the user to see pets on individual pet cards, view additional pet information by hovering over a card, allow users to create new pet submissions, and allow users to vote for pets.

In this project, we utilized HTML, JavaScript, JSON, and CSS.

We used HTML to create the HTML website and display the header and pet submission form.

We used Javascript to implement various functions, such as hover & click event listeners, form submits, & for each to implement a filter feature.

We styled our website by using CSS and our backend is run off of a JSON server that we created.
